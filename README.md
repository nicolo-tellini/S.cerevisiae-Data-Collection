## :page_facing_up: gVCF/BCF FEATURES

The fastqs have been aligned against [S288C_reference_genome_R64-3-1_20210421.fa](http://sgd-archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64-3-1_20210421.tgz). 

The files are both provided in binary (```.bcf```) and text format (```.gvcf```).

All the genomic positions are included (as long as at least 1 strain has been genotyped at that position).

Chromosome names are lower case and (sadly) mantain roman numerals eg. chrIII (chrMT is the only exception).

For the joy of bioinfo, strain names are replaced by the ENA archive *Run Accession*.

The HOWTO below allows to rename the strains in the header.

<details><summary>Example</summary>
    
  The strain **UWO 03-433.3** in the gVCF is named ERR1352879. Renaming ERR1352879 results in **UWO 03-433.3** 
  
</details>
     
The use of the Run Accession facilitates the filtering phase.

This prevents the misselection of strains with overlapping, similar or multisymbolic names.

By default, the gVCF/BCF was filter as follow:

- MQ >= 5

- QUAL >= 20

- DP >= 10

Important: some of the *S.cerevisiae* isolates were made available via custom website; these strains are listed in *additionalstrains.txt* and the data stored in *additionalstrains.gvcf.gz* and *additionalstrains.bcf.gz*

Along with the gVCFs/BCFs files we provide a table (*perstraingenotypedpos.txt*) in which we report the number (and the percentage) of positions genotyped for each strain, compared to S288C reference genome length. 

This last table should be used to run a first filtering of the data.

## :wrench: HOWTO

Before subsetting, index the VCF with 

```
bcftools index gvcf.gz
```

 - extract per-sample/s data
 ```
 bcftools view -S thisFIELcontainsONEstrainPERline.txt gvcf.gz -Oz -o myfavoritesamples.gvcf.gz
 ```

 - extract per-region/s data
 ```
 bcftools view -R thisFILEcontainsCHRstartENDtabSEPARATEDcoordinates.bed gvcf.gz -Oz -o myfavoritesamples.gvcf.gz
 ```
 
 - extract only variant positions (SNPs)
 ```
 bcftools view -e 'ALT="."' gvcf.gz -Oz -o vcf.gz
 ```
 
 - replace ENA archive Run Accession codes with the original strain names
 
 ```
 bcftools reheader --samples fromENAtoStrainName.txt -Oz -o vcf.renamed.gz vcf.gz
 ```
 
  <details><summary>Important</summary>
    
  The strain names in *fromENAtoStrainName.txt* **must** follow the order of the ENA codes in the header. The file we provide is already ordered but, if you subsetted by samples you need to subset *fromENAtoStrainName.txt* and be sure the order is mantained as intended. 
  
</details>
 
 - renaming any other ```.txt``` file from downstream analyses.
   
   Make a copy of the ```.txt``` file before running ```sed```.
 
   ```
   for j in $(cut -f1 DATAonSCER.csv | grep -v vcfname)
   do
    k=$(grep -w $j DATAonSCER.csv | cut -f2)
    sed -i "s+\<${j}\>+${k}+g" myresults.txt
   done
   ```

## :paperclip: ADDITIONAL DATA

Additional data are stored in a network attached storage (NAS) and shared through a personal *link* protected by *password*; both will be provided by email.

The **password** is *personal and unique*.

The **access** to the data is *restricted* to a few devices for security reasons.

The **validity period** of the link is *limited to the date the download is ultimated*.

Additional data:
